# node-dynamic-db-seed
Dynamically seed files based in collumn changes 

### What it does? 
 - In automatic mode, get [Table 1] and compare collumns of [Table 2]. In case new collums were added/removed form [Table 1], it will create seed files. 
 - In manual mode, you can set all expected collumns and validate if exists in [Table 2]. In case it doesn't. It will create seed files


 ### What we want to do aswell? 

 - Make it runs migrations automatically
 - Connect to AWS
